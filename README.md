# linkedin-messenger
A small web application that uses OAuth 2.0 to connect to the LinkedIn API and allow automated messages to be sent.

Built using:
* Node.js / Express.js

Consists of:
* a node module I made which handles the linked in OAuth 2.0 stuff neatly
* a web UI for sending messages based on the profile of the user and the apps permissions to the Linkein API
